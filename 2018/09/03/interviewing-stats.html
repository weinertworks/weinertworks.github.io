            <p>As of August 14th, I have a new job!</p>
            <h2 id="oops">Oops!</h2>
            <p>I didnâ€™t plan to find a new job. I wanted to start my own company and was going to stay put until I could start my own thing. A friend talked me into applying for a tech lead position at his company. I had the qualifications, and it would have been a huge promotion. I applied for other jobs, but I didnâ€™t think any of them could beat this.</p>
            <p>It was my first onsite interview, and I bombed it.</p>
            <h2 id="doh">Doh!</h2>
            <p>My first onsite had only one technical interview. They asked me to model what happens when a user buys an SSL certificate. They didnâ€™t say it explicitly, but they wanted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>. I didnâ€™t know what that was. I thought they wanted me to design a system, so I started mapping out services.</p>
            <p>My solution was way too complicated and confusing. I can blame my nerves, but I spent all of my prep-time reviewing <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> and working <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/">Leet Codeâ€™s interview questions</a>. The question was new, so I was unprepared. Bombing this question helped me prepare for later interviews.</p>
            <p>I regret that my first choice was my first onsite.</p>
            <h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>
            <p>If I hadnâ€™t applied to other companies, I wouldâ€™ve mourned my lost free-time and given up on interviewing for another year. Instead, I doubled the number of applications I had, and continued studying in my free time.</p>

            <h3 id="homework-is-a-crapshoot">Homework Is a Crapshoot</h3>
            <p>Every company judges homework differently.</p>
            <p>I spent a week working on a homework assignment for [data metrics company] only to be rejected for doing the bare minimum. They purposefully left the scope vague to see if a candidate would go above and beyond.</p>
            <p>Another homework assignment I wrote in two hours and emailed it to the recruiter with notes on what I would improve if I had more time. It was good enough to skip a technical phone screen and jump straight to onsite.</p>
            <h3 id="no-one-thinks-twice-about-your-interview">No One Thinks Twice About Your Interview</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™d heard that <a href="http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html#number-8-interviews-matter-much-much-more-to-you-than-to-the-company">interviews matter more to you than the company interviewing you</a>. I didnâ€™t expect to have hard proof. I ran into two people one to two weeks after they had interviewed me. Neither recognized me or remembered my interview once I brought it up.</p>
            <p>One exception was an interview I had with a CTO. He interviewed me when he was the VP of development at a different company. He remembered me. I shouldâ€™ve asked if that was a good thing or a bad thing. ðŸ˜…</p>
            <h2 id="i-love-my-new-job">I Love My New Job</h2>
            <p>Itâ€™s only been two weeks, but I love my new job. Itâ€™s 100% remote, and most of my team is remote. The team is brand new built to implement a killer new product. I couldnâ€™t be more excited.</p>
