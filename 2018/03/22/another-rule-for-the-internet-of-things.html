            <p>My first gen <a href="https://www.automatic.com">Automatic</a> doesn’t reliably track my location anymore, but it’s worth keeping around for its error codes. There is no confidence like walking into a repair shop already knowing what’s wrong with your car.</p>
            <p>People love <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/speed-queen-washer/">when appliances are repairable</a>. If smart appliances told you what was wrong and how to fix the wrong, they’d be loved too.</p>
