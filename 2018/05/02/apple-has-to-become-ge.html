They absolutely should have, but it’s a shame. The Airport Express was terrible. If you used it for a Time Machine backup, everyone else’s internet connection would stall.

            <p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/apple-at-its-best/">Peak iPhone</a> is going to be a thing. Even if Apple was successful enough to <a href="#apple-ge-1-aside1">sell an iPhone to every person on earth</a>, they would hit peak iPhone. Investors don’t want stable, consistent returns. They want growth! Apple needs to grow its product line. It’s going to turn into G.E.</p>
            <p>Ignore the Homepod, which is <a href="#apple-ge-1-aside3">failing</a> because Siri is terrible. Selling more products to your current customers is the best strategy.</p>
            <p>Wait. What the fuck am I talking about. The Homepod might be the <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2018/01/24/on-homepod-and-audio-quality/">best product no one buys</a>. It costs $50 more than the Bose Soundlink I bought in 2013 and has reviews comparing it to a $50,000 speaker? I… want that. Hell, I want Apple to <a href="http://www.righto.com/2015/11/macbook-charger-teardown-surprising.html?m=1">design the power cables and other boring parts of my home appliances.</a></p>
            <p>I want to live in a world where <a href="#apple-ge-1-aside3">Apple is making my toaster oven</a>.</p>
            <ol>
              <li id="apple-ge-1-aside1">Apple will never sell everyone a phone. People's taste are too different, and some people don't like Apple for forcing its tastes on you.</li>
              <li id="apple-ge-1-aside2">I love that a failed product for Apple would be a huge success for any other company.</li>
              <li id="apple-ge-1-aside3">I don't own a toaster oven. They're all terrible.</li>
