            <h2 id="at-work">At Work</h2>
            <p>Once a service is running in production, it never gets turned off. Decommissioning a service always ends with realizing some unknown party was using it and still needs it for their job. The standards for testing should be higher.</p>
            <p>You’re not the only person working on your project. There’s no better way to communicate to your teammates how you expect code to behave than good tests. Having a unit test for a ticket makes it harder to reintroduce the bug.</p>
            <p>If you’re starting a new service from scratch, testing should be a part of your project from the beginning. Pick frameworks that are easy to test. At work, we don’t use any Go router frameworks. They’re a huge pain to setup before each test.</p>
            <h2 id="at-home">At Home</h2>
            <p>In your personal projects, you’re the only person working on it. If you stop, it’s more likely to be abandoned than passed to another developer. It’s hard to justify tests if the project might not last a year.</p>
            <p>Unless you’re a pro at project management and have strict requirements, your side projects are going to have higher code churn than at work. How can you justify writing acceptance tests for a web page whose layout is constantly being tweaked?</p>
            <p>Test as much as you can, but don’t beat yourself up over it.</p>
